The big question is can we simply take the AQL dedicated to the transaction for the 
	Subassemblies and just use them as a placeholder for the tulips?
	Or will we get different results if we break up the sub assem components?

	>> In this example there was only a 2% error.
		HOWEVER - THis is only becuase we only had to scrap a FEW parts from the lot
		of the subassmebly jobs. If we ended up scrapping a lot then we would be
		over-inflating the AQL attributed to inspection.



Can we use the ROUND(jh.OriginalProdQty * 1.1,0) instead of the jh.ProdQty?
ProdQty doesnt dictate the amount of inspection we do in reality, however we are treating it this way
in the query and if we scrapped a lot of parts mid-way this could throw us into a different AQL Bracket

	>> Nope, nvm we're fine here. We dont actually apply the 10% when calculating the AQL


In every PO we can have a lines broken up becuase
they are a different length or because they are a 
different diameter.

	Can we find the minimum number of setups per Order?

-----------------------------------------------------------

Objective:
	query up the tulips and extensions in a line item in such a manner
	that we have:
	the line-item job number on the left,
	the qty of tulips / extensions transferred in the middle
	the original production qty on the right



Do we need to filter out (-) negative transaction quantities?

	These negative transaction quantities seem to usually mean DOUBLE positive quantities.
	Find evidence of this, might mean that we need to DISTINCTly search here.
